# Service Review Document

This document serves as a baseline to review the current state of each microservice in the StockAutoTrader project. It covers three key aspects:
- **Logging Configuration**
- **Error Handling Practices**
- **Configuration (Environment Variables, Config Files, etc.)**

As we implement improvements (e.g., structured logging, better error handling, and secure configuration management), this document will be updated to track our progress.

## Microservices

The project currently comprises the following services:
- **DataFlow**
- **Quant**
- **RiskOps**
- **ExecConnect**

## Review Table

Please fill in the table below based on your code reviews. Note any gaps or areas that need improvement (e.g., "logs are plain text; consider switching to JSON", "try/except blocks too generic", etc.).

| Microservice | Logging Configuration                                            | Error Handling Practices                                          | Configuration (Env Vars, Files)                       |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| DataFlow     | e.g., uses Python's `logging.basicConfig` with simple format; logs to stdout.  | e.g., try/except around RabbitMQ calls; minimal exception details. | e.g., reads RABBITMQ_HOST, RABBITMQ_USER, RABBITMQ_PASS from env; uses `.env.example` for defaults. |
| Quant        |                                                                  |                                                                   |                                                       |
| RiskOps      |                                                                  |                                                                   |                                                       |
| ExecConnect  |                                                                  |                                                                   |                                                       |

## Detailed Instructions

1. **Logging Configuration:**  
   - Open each microservice’s main file (e.g., `dataflow/main.py`, `quant/main.py`, etc.).
   - Locate the logging setup (typically a call to `logging.basicConfig` and logger instantiation like `logger = logging.getLogger("ServiceName")`).
   - Document:
     - Which logging library is used.
     - The format of log messages (plain text, JSON, etc.).
     - Where logs are output (stdout, file, etc.).
   - Note any areas for improvement (for instance, adopting a JSON formatter for structured logging).

2. **Error Handling Practices:**  
   - Identify try/except blocks and review how exceptions are caught.
   - Note whether error messages include sufficient detail (e.g., stack traces, contextual info).
   - Document if retries or fallback mechanisms are implemented.
   - Mark any areas that could benefit from more granular exception handling.

3. **Configuration:**  
   - Review how each service loads its configuration:
     - Which environment variables are used (e.g., `RABBITMQ_HOST`, etc.).
     - Any external configuration files (like `.env`, YAML, JSON config files).
     - The presence of default values if environment variables are missing.
   - Note any inconsistencies or missing documentation that should be addressed.

4. **Inline Annotations:**  
   - While reviewing the code, add `# TODO:` comments in sections where improvements are needed (e.g., “# TODO: Add structured JSON logging”).
   - This helps track specific changes alongside the code.

## Next Steps

- **Team Review:**  
  Schedule a meeting with your developers and the DevOps engineer to go through each service and complete the table above.
  
- **Prioritization:**  
  Use the documented gaps to prioritize tasks in your project tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues). For example, if multiple services are missing structured logging, that becomes an immediate priority.
  
- **Baseline for Future Improvements:**  
  Update this document as changes are implemented. It will serve as both a historical record and a checklist to ensure all improvements are consistently applied.

Feel free to modify this template as needed for your workflow. Once you have this document in place, you'll have a clear picture of your current state, which will guide further improvements in security, logging, error handling, and overall service quality.
