# StockAutoTrader

StockAutoTrader is a multi-agent, microservices-based automated trading system. It leverages RabbitMQ for message passing, PostgreSQL for data storage, and four specialized services to manage the trading pipeline: DataFlow, Quant, RiskOps, and ExecConnect. This project is developed using an AI-assisted workflow with dedicated agents for project management and coding.

## Project Overview
StockAutoTrader is designed to automate stock trading by processing market data, generating trade signals, applying risk management, and executing orders. The system is built with modular microservices and a collaborative AI development workflow.

	•	Design_Specification_Document.md: Contains the detailed design and specifications for data schemas, message formats, function signatures, and agent responsibilities.

Prerequisites
	•	Docker & Docker Compose (or Docker Engine with built-in Compose)
	•	(Optional) Python 3.9+ for local testing or script execution
	•	Git for cloning and version control

Getting Started

Clone & Setup

git clone https://github.com/Solders-Girdles/StockAutoTrader.git
cd StockAutoTrader

Environment Variables
	•	Rename .env.example to .env and update the placeholder values as required.
	•	Note: Default credentials (for RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL) are for development only. Change them before production use.

Build & Run

Build and run the system using Docker Compose:

docker compose up --build

This command will:
	1.	Start RabbitMQ (management UI available at http://localhost:15672).
	2.	Launch PostgreSQL on port 5432.
	3.	Build and run each microservice container (dataflow, quant, riskops, execconnect).

Press Ctrl+C to stop the services.

Services Overview

DataFlow
	•	Location: dataflow/
	•	Purpose: Ingests (mock or real) market data and publishes it to the market_data queue.
	•	Key Functions:
	•	fetch_market_data() -> dict
	•	publish_market_data(data: dict) -> None

Quant
	•	Location: quant/
	•	Purpose: Subscribes to the market_data queue, applies trading strategy logic (e.g., moving averages), and publishes trade signals to the trade_signals queue.
	•	Key Functions:
	•	process_market_data(data: dict) -> dict
	•	compute_signal(data: dict) -> dict
	•	publish_trade_signal(signal: dict) -> None

RiskOps
	•	Location: riskops/
	•	Purpose: Consumes trade signals from trade_signals, applies risk management (e.g., 2% rule, daily PnL limits), updates portfolio metrics, and publishes approved trades to the approved_trades queue.
	•	Key Functions:
	•	evaluate_risk(signal: dict) -> bool
	•	update_portfolio(signal: dict) -> None
	•	publish_approved_trade(signal: dict) -> None

ExecConnect
	•	Location: execconnect/
	•	Purpose: Receives approved trades from approved_trades, executes orders (via a broker API or a mock interface), and logs trade executions to the PostgreSQL database.
	•	Key Functions:
	•	execute_trade(trade: dict) -> dict
	•	log_trade_execution(execution_result: dict) -> None

Design & Specification Document
	•	Refer to Design_Specification_Document.md for detailed data schemas, message formats, function signatures, and a breakdown of responsibilities for each AI agent.
	•	This document is the single source of truth for system architecture and must be kept up-to-date as the project evolves.

Project Management & AI Agent Workflow
	•	AI Agent Roles:
	•	O1-Pro (Project Manager): Oversees overall project integration, task assignments, and code reviews.
	•	O3-mini-high Agents: Each is responsible for implementing specific microservices (DataFlow, Quant, RiskOps, ExecConnect).
	•	Task Management:
	•	Use GitHub Issues or your preferred task board to track discrete tasks derived from the design document.
	•	Milestones and periodic status updates are required from each agent.
	•	Communication:
	•	Daily standup updates and code reviews will ensure all agents are aligned.
	•	Changes must be documented and integrated into both the design document and this README.

Database & Messaging

Database
	•	Service: PostgreSQL (via Docker Compose)
	•	Default Credentials: user=myuser, password=mypass, database=traderdb
	•	Access:

docker compose exec db psql -U myuser -d traderdb



Message Passing (RabbitMQ)
	•	Service: RabbitMQ (via Docker Compose)
	•	Management UI: http://localhost:15672 (login with credentials from .env)
	•	Queues:
	•	market_data – DataFlow publishes market data.
	•	trade_signals – Quant publishes trade signals.
	•	approved_trades – RiskOps publishes approved trades.

Future Improvements
	•	Data Integration: Move from mock data to real-time market data feeds (e.g., Polygon, Alpha Vantage, Alpaca).
	•	Advanced Strategies: Add additional trading strategies including multi-indicator and ML-based signals.
	•	Enhanced Risk Management: Incorporate more sophisticated risk assessments (e.g., sector exposure, correlation checks).
	•	Broker API Integration: Connect ExecConnect to a live or paper trading API.
	•	Logging & Monitoring: Implement structured logging and monitoring dashboards (using Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK).
	•	Dashboard Development: Build a real-time visualization dashboard for trade performance.

This updated README now clearly outlines the overall architecture, agent roles, design document reference, and task management practices. It’s designed to keep all team members (human or AI) aligned as we move forward with our improvements. Let me know if further adjustments are needed or if we should proceed with the next implementation steps.
