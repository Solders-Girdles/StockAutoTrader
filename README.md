Below is a sample README.md that you can adapt for your StockAutoTrader project. It covers the overall structure, how to run the system via Docker Compose, how each service works (DataFlow, Quant, RiskOps, ExecConnect), and some notes on configuration/environment variables. Feel free to customize or expand on any section—particularly if you want to add more detailed usage instructions, environment variable references, or advanced deployment notes.

StockAutoTrader

StockAutoTrader is a multi-agent, microservices-based trading system that uses RabbitMQ for message passing, PostgreSQL for data storage, and four specialized services:
	1.	DataFlow – Ingests real or mock market data and publishes it to market_data queue.
	2.	Quant – Consumes market data, applies trading strategy logic (e.g., moving averages), and publishes signals to trade_signals.
	3.	RiskOps – Consumes signals, applies risk constraints (portfolio checks, daily PnL limits, etc.), and publishes approved trades to approved_trades.
	4.	ExecConnect – Consumes approved trades, executes them (mock or real broker API), and logs fills to the database.

	•	riskops/: Code & Dockerfile for RiskOps (risk management).
	•	execconnect/: Code & Dockerfile for broker/order execution logic.

Prerequisites
	1.	Docker & Docker Compose (or Docker Engine with built-in compose).
	2.	(Optional) Python 3.9+ locally if you want to run scripts or tests outside Docker.
	3.	Git to clone this repo.

Getting Started

Clone & Setup

git clone https://github.com/Solders-Girdles/StockAutoTrader.git
cd StockAutoTrader

Environment Variables
	•	Check .env.example for placeholders like BROKER_API_KEY, DB_HOST, etc.
	•	You can rename .env.example to .env, fill in real values (if needed), and in docker-compose.yml you can load it using env_file: .env (if not already present).
	•	For the basic run, the defaults in the Compose file might suffice (RabbitMQ user/pass, Postgres user/pass).

Build & Run

docker compose up --build

This will:
	1.	Pull/run RabbitMQ with management UI on http://localhost:15672.
	2.	Pull/run Postgres for the DB on port 5432.
	3.	Build each microservice container (dataflow, quant, riskops, execconnect), install dependencies, and start them.

You’ll see logs from each service in the terminal. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

Services Overview

DataFlow
	•	Path: dataflow/
	•	Purpose: Fetch (mock or real) market data and publish to market_data queue.
	•	Key Files:
	•	main.py: Contains logic to connect to RabbitMQ, generate/fetch data, and publish.
	•	requirements.txt: Typically includes pika, requests, psycopg2-binary if needed for DB logs.

Quant
	•	Path: quant/
	•	Purpose: Subscribes to market_data queue, applies strategy logic (e.g., moving averages), publishes signals to trade_signals queue.
	•	Key Files:
	•	main.py: Listens for data points, does calculations, and publishes signals.
	•	requirements.txt: Might include pika, numpy, pandas, psycopg2-binary (optional) for logging signals in DB.

RiskOps
	•	Path: riskops/
	•	Purpose: Consumes trade_signals, applies risk constraints, updates portfolio in Postgres, publishes approved trades to approved_trades.
	•	Key Files:
	•	main.py: Contains the risk logic (2% rule, daily PnL, etc.), DB usage for portfolio, and message passing to next queue.
	•	requirements.txt: Typically includes pika + psycopg2-binary.

ExecConnect
	•	Path: execconnect/
	•	Purpose: Receives approved_trades, mocks or calls a real broker API to place orders, logs them in Postgres.
	•	Key Files:
	•	main.py: Subscribes to approved_trades, finalizes orders, stores them in trades table.
	•	requirements.txt: pika, psycopg2-binary, plus any broker libraries if hooking up to a real paper API.

Database
	•	Service: db in docker-compose.yml is a Postgres container.
	•	Credentials: (default) user=myuser, pass=mypass, db=traderdb.
	•	Persistent Volume: postgres_data to avoid losing data on container restarts.
	•	Usage: Each microservice can read/write tables (portfolio, trades, etc.) via environment variables (e.g., DB_HOST=db, DB_USER=myuser).

To inspect or debug:

docker compose exec db psql -U myuser -d traderdb

Then normal SQL commands, e.g. SELECT * FROM trades;.

Message Passing (RabbitMQ)
	•	Service: rabbitmq in docker-compose.yml, ports 5672 (AMQP) & 15672 (management UI).
	•	Credentials: user=myuser, pass=mypass.
	•	Queues:
	•	market_data – used by DataFlow → consumed by Quant.
	•	trade_signals – published by Quant → consumed by RiskOps.
	•	approved_trades – published by RiskOps → consumed by ExecConnect.
	•	Access UI: http://localhost:15672 (login with myuser/mypass).

Future Improvements
	1.	Real Data: Switch DataFlow from mock to real-time sources (Polygon, Alpha Vantage, Alpaca).
	2.	Advanced Strategies: Add more indicators, ML-based signals, multi-symbol logic in Quant.
	3.	Sophisticated Risk: Factor-based constraints, sector exposures, correlation checks in RiskOps.
	4.	Live Broker API: Integrate ExecConnect with a paper trading account (Alpaca or IBKR).
	5.	Logging & Monitoring: Use structured logs, set up a monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana or ELK).
	6.	Dashboard: Build a “VizMaster” service that shows real-time PnL, positions, and trades.

Conclusion

With this README, new developers or collaborators can see how your system is structured, how to run it, and what each microservice does. As you refine the code, update the docs with advanced usage, environment variable references, or deployment best practices. Happy trading!
